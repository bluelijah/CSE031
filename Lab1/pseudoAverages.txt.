//for each player input, add to a list, or vector, 
//then once 0 is entered, in a nested for loop, take the first value of the vector, and add it to the next
//then divide this by modulo to see if its even or odd. add to even or odd integer, then increase a counter for either even or odd sums
// once the nested loop has added all them together n!, solve for the average sums by dividing the int by its respective counter


//while loop that infinitely functions until broken
//print the user prompt
//check the user prompt
//break if 0
//add to list if not
//add counter for even and odd while summing
//sum digits
//find sum totals
//print out results
//format to liking
